# CygnOS
A hobby x86 OS created from scratch.

***Note: I haven't had the time to work on this of late (grad school -_-), but intend to get back to it as soon as possible. Currently, I'm in the middle of implementing the virtual memory manager (a first implementation of the physical memory manager is done), but might also take up development of the keyboard driver in parallel.***
